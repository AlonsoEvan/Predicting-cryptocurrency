# Predicting-cryptocurrency

A scripts who aim to predict some cryptocurrency like bitcoin.  You just need to download the .py and run in your command prompt.

You can specify any currency you want between : "BTC-USD", "LTC-USD", "BCH-USD", "ETH-USD"

This kind of work is really useful in term of business value. Stock prices are really volatile, hence very hard to predict so it's very appreciated for companies if you know the tricks. Moreover it's a very powerful way to train yourself because like I said previously, stock prices are strongly volatile and it's quite impossible to predict perfectly.


The model could be improved, but let us not forgot that Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. This means that there are no consistent patterns in the data that allow you to model stock prices over time near-perfectly.

I've seen on internet some people mention that stock (and other) prices are unforecastable, because if there were some way of forecasting them, people would use that forecast to go short or long, instantaneously driving the price to the "true" value.
